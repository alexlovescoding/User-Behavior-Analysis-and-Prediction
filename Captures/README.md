## Captures of the project - Reproducible & Replicable

This project contains 4 notebook files and each consists of at least 100 cells. It would be complicated and inconvenient to take screenshots of the running cells. Instead, I export the files into html format, from which you could see all files have been re-runned through the beginning indicated by number 1 next to the first cell, and consecutive numbers in the followings. For a video showcasing how to run these files, the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EjyWj2cC_HsgGtnGX_sPOx4b5enBDiBA/view?usp=sharing) is shared via Google Drive. 

To replicate this work yourself, please follow the guidances under the master directory and make sure you meet the dependency requirements. Please also follow the instruction in /data to acquire the necessary geological information databases.
